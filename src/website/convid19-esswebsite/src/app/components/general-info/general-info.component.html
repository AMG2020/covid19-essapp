<h3>How does it <span>spread</span>?</h3><br>
<h4><span>Person-to-person spread</span></h4>
<p>
The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</li>
<li>Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</li>
</ul>
<p>These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.</p>
<br>
<h4>Can someone spread the virus without being sick?</h4>
<ul>
<li>People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).</li>
<li>Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span>Spread from contact with contaminated surfaces or objects</span></h4>
<p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
</div><br>
<h4>How easily the virus spreads</h4>
<p>How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, spreading continually without stopping.

  The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas.</p>

<h3>Common <span>Symptoms</span></h3>
<h4>Watch for symptoms</h4>
<p>Reported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.
  <br>
  The following symptoms may appear <strong>2-14 days after exposure.*</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fever</li>
  <li>Cough</li>
  <li>Shortness of breath</li>
</ul>
<p>*This is based on what has been seen previously as the incubation period of MERS-CoV viruses.</p>

<h3>Vaccine and <span>Treatment</span></h3>
<h4>Know How it Spreads</h4>
<ul>
  <li>There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</li>
  <li>The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.</li>
  <li>The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</li>
    <li>Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.</li>
