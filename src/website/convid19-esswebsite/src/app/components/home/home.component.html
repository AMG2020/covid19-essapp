          <h3>What is Corona Virus?</h3>
          <p>Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).<br>
          <br>  Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.<br>
              <br>
              Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.  Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. <br>
             <br>
             Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.<br>
              <br>
              Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.</p>

          <h4 style="float:left !important;">Clean your hands often</h4>
          <p style="float:left !important; text-align: left !important;"><strong>Wash your hands</strong> often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.<br>
          <br>  If soap and water are not readily available, <strong>use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol</strong>. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth</strong> with unwashed hands. <br>
             <br>
            </p>
            <h4 style="float:left !important;">Avoid close contact</h4>
            <p style="float:left !important; text-align: left !important;">
              <strong>Avoid close contact</strong> with people who are sick<br>
              Put <strong>distance between yourself and other people</strong> if COVID-19 is spreading in your community. This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.
